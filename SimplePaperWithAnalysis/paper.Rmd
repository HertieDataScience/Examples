# Explanation

I gathered data from @Pemstein2010 on countries' democracy level. They call their
democracy measure the Unified Democracy Score (UDS). I also gathered data from
the @WorldBank2013 on fertilizer consumption.[^units] Figure 1 shows the mean
UDS scores over time for all of the countries in their sample plotted against
the natural logarithm of their fertilizer consumption.

# The Plot

The following is a plot. It was created using the R [@CiteR] ggplot2 [@R-ggplot2].

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.cap='Mean UDS Scores vs. Fertilizer Consumption'}
# Run source code to create scatter plot
source("Analysis/ScatterUDS_Fert.R")
```


[^units]: The data is in kilograms per hectare of arable land.
